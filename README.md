# Portfolio

Hi, my name is Michael Crowther. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a Computer Science degree. My goal is to take aspiring ideas and transform them into scalable and visually appealing applications. I have a passion for making things work, and aim to change the world with software. This portfolio site is a SPA React application, and is currently a work in progress.
